 Based on analyzing the collection of academic papers, I have identified five prominent recent trends in text-to-video generation models, with a key focus on controllability, multimodality, video quality improvements, image animation, and personalized video generation. 

<b>Controllability</b>: Recent works have focused on improving control over generated videos through multimodal inputs like text, images, depth maps, etc. Models leverage techniques like attention mechanisms, ControlNets, and classifier guidance to enable precise conditioning on desired visual semantics. This facilitates applications like video editing, geometry-controlled generation, and subject customization.

<b>Multimodality</b>: Leveraging multiple input modalities like text, images, audio, depth maps etc. is an emerging trend to improve conditioning and allow for fine-grained control over generated video attributes. Models employ techniques like cross-attention over multimodal embeddings and masked blending to effectively utilize complementary strengths of different input types.

<b>Video quality improvements</b>: Recent video diffusion models aim to enhance the visual quality and temporal consistency of generated videos using spatial-temporal architectures, noise scheduling optimizations and loss functions tailored for video data. Models also reuse weights from high-quality image diffusion models as initialization to benefit from their superior generative capabilities.

<b>Image animation</b>: Animating still images into video using textual prompts is an area of increasing research focus. Methods employ techniques like masked conditions, viewpoint consistency losses, and warping-based rendering to transform input images into realistic and temporally coherent videos.

<b>Personalized video generation</b>: Customizing foundation models using few samples for user-specific video generation enables applications like talking avatars and virtual assistants. Approaches rely on model fine-tuning, adapters, or additional cross-attention layers to inject personalization without requiring extensive retraining.
