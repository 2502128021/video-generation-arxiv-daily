 Based on analyzing the collection of academic papers on talking face generation, here is a summary of five prominent recent trends and developments:

<b>Neural radiance fields (NeRFs)</b>: Many recent papers explore using neural radiance fields to represent talking faces in 3D. NeRFs can model view-dependent effects and complex geometry. Papers show NeRFs can achieve photo-realistic reconstruction and animation of talking heads from images or video. However, most methods require expensive per-person training. Recent trends look to make NeRF talking faces generalizable in a one-shot setting.

<b>Generative models</b>: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) are popular for modeling talking faces. They can synthesize video frames conditioned on audio or motion. Diffusion models are an emerging trend, as they can generate sharper results and enable new applications like face editing. Recent papers also explore ways to control emotion, pose, expression, and other attributes of generated talking faces.

<b>Controllable generation</b>: Many papers focus on controlling aspects of talking face generation like speech, expression, gaze, and head pose. This includes disentangling factors of variation and learning interpretable controls. Recent trends use conditioned models like NeRFs to enable control over viewpoints. There is also interest in controlling generation using natural language prompts.

<b>Limited data</b>: A prevalent trend is reducing data requirements for talking face models through transfer learning, few-shot adaptation, and pretraining. This allows high-quality controllable talking faces to be synthesized for new people with less data. Approaches leverage 3D priors, perceptual losses, and modularity to improve data efficiency.

<b>Full avatar generation</b>: Recent papers are beginning to address generating full avatars rather than just the face region. This includes modeling the torso, shoulders, background, and body gestures to accompany speech. The focus is on natural motion and seamless transitions between spontaneous and non-spontaneous movements to improve realism.
